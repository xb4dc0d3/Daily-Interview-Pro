Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

Given a list of words, for each word find the shortest unique prefix. 
You can assume a word will not be a substring of another word (ie play and playing won't be in the same words list)

Example

Input: ['joma', 'john', 'jack', 'techlead']
Output: ['jom', 'joh', 'ja', 't']

'''


def shortest_unique_prefix(words):
    pass
  
  
print(shortest_unique_prefix(['joma', 'john', 'jack', 'techlead']))
# ['jom', 'joh', 'ja', 't']
